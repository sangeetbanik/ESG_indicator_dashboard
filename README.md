# ESG_indicator_dashboard
## üìù Introduction 
Through this analysis project our goal is to apply ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria to countries around the world and create visualizations that track how these nations have evolved over time. ESG is a framework used by investors to assess where their money is going and how it can be used to make a positive impact. Given the growing concerns around global warming and the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, ESG topics have never been more relevant. This project explores the importance of ESG, not only for investors but for global well-being as a whole.
