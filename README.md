# ESG_indicator_dashboard
## üìù Introduction 
Through this analysis project our goal is to apply ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria to countries around the world and create visualizations that track how these nations have evolved over time. ESG is a framework used by investors to assess where their money is going and how it can be used to make a positive impact. Given the growing concerns around global warming and the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, ESG topics have never been more relevant. This project explores the importance of ESG, not only for investors but for global well-being as a whole.

#### Considerations
* I have selected 9 indicators, which are classified into Environment,  Social and Governance as following:-
    - Environment : CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita), Electricity production from coal sources (% of total), and Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption).
    - Social      : Literacy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above), Fertility rate, total (births per woman) and Fertility rate, total (births per woman).
    - Governance  : Control of Corruption: Estimate, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Estimate and Strength of legal rights index (0=weak to 12=strong).
